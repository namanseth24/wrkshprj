            Our workshop project, created by Team 12, aims to address two important agricultural needs: pest control and weather monitoring.<BR>
             The Solar-scarecrow is a innovative solution designed to deter pests from crops by utilizing solar-powered motion sensors and automated scare tactics. <BR>Additionally, our project includes a Weather Station that collects real-time data on temperature, humidity, and rainfall, providing farmers with crucial information for making informed decisions about their crops.<br> Through this project, we hope to enhance farming practices and contribute to sustainable agriculture.<br>Our workshop project, created by Team 12, aims to address two important agricultural needs: pest control and weather monitoring.<br> The Solar-scarecrow is a innovative solution designed to deter pests from crops by utilizing solar-powered motion sensors and automated scare tactics.<br> Additionally, our project includes a Weather Station that collects real-time data on temperature, humidity, and rainfall, providing farmers with crucial information for making informed decisions about their crops.<br> Through this project, we hope to enhance farming practices and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

                How it works
                
                The Solar-scarecrow
                
                Works by detecting the motion of pests within a designated range using solar-powered motion sensors. Upon detecting motion, the scarecrow's automated scare tactics are activated, such as loud noises , effectively deterring the pests from the crops.
                
                The Weather Station
                
                Collects data on temperature, humidity, and rainfall using sensors, which is then transmitted to a central server for real-time monitoring and analysis by farmers. This help the farmer to maintain their crop according to weather.
